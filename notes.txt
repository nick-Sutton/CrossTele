Meeting Notes
    - Gait selection
    - Velocities for rigid bodies(Twist?)
    - solving controller descp(Controller may not be able to move as fast as human moves)
    - I want to be able to swap out the controller for other controllers with similar command structures

    -scaling of the velocities are greater than the controller can handel
        - In this case I think the robot should still try to traverse the same distance but with more walk commands in between
        - Instead of having twist as a matric just use the two velocities
        - We need to perform a cordinate transformation

    -Example Command from CrossTele directory
        python3 teleop/src/teleop.py --input_mode=offline --io_mode=mujoco --input_file=./training/dataset/FormattedData/Walk_forward_000.csv


Tasks:
    Get Some performance metrics.
        - Add human to mujoco scene
        - Add performance logging for each timestep
        - Read some papers on what performance metrics to use

    Possible metrics:
        - Tracking accuracy
        - Tracking speed (how fast can we go from receiving info to the robot moving)

    Introduce Type hints into the codebase:

-Get human gat periodcity for Phases at each time step

        #metrics = {
        #    'rmse': np.sqrt(np.mean(pos_error**2)),     # Root mean square Error
        #    'mae': np.mean(pos_error),                  # mean error
        #    'max_error': np.max(pos_error),             # max error
        #    'std_error': np.std(pos_error),             # standard error
        #    'median_error': np.median(pos_error)        # median error
        #}
